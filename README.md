# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a logistic regression model trained on a dataset of credit card transactions to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue affecting financial institutions and customers worldwide. Detecting fraudulent transactions early can prevent financial losses and protect customers' funds. This project addresses this problem by implementing a machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared to handle missing values and ensure balanced classes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
  
- **Model Training**: Logistic regression is chosen as the classification algorithm due to its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
